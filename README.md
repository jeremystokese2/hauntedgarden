# how do i use it
use a desktop
hover over the squares with your mouse
.. spooky, right?

# why?
dunno. coz i wanted to test our hyperscript? this is 10 mins of work and belongs on jsfiddle, not github

# //TODO

- [x] make it play sound
- [ ] fix the css to expand the grid to the whole screen
- [ ] make code DRYer. use hyperscript installed behaviour?
- [ ] use hs to get screen width and height on load and calc the right rows/col needed, then generate `<p />`'s
- [ ] add `onclick`
- [ ] fix static hosting on github so it can access `./audioData.js`
- [ ] make it pretty
- [ ] more notes! more range!
- [ ] change favicon based on last emoji sent. change title
- [ ] mobile-friendly. hyperscript api has no support for touch events... hmm...
